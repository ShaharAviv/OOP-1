This program we realizing simple objects of geometric shapes and draws them on screen.

Files:
Rectangle.cpp & Rectangle.h: A rectangle parallel to the axes.
EquilateralTriangle.cpp & EquilateralTriangle.h: An equilateral triangle with a base parallel to the x-axis.
Window.cpp & Window.h: Object of frame that build from rectangle in rectangle.
StarOfDavid.cpp & StarOfDavid.h: A Star of David composed of two equilateral triangles (up and down).

Remarkable Algorithms:

bool "shape" ::scale(double factor);
in Rectangle & EquilateralTriangle.

Known bugs:
NULL~
